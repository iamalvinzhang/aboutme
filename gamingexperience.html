    <p>I've been a competitive person my entire life and one of the ways I channeled that energy was through video games.
         What began with Mario Bros and Duck Hunt on the Nintendo NES ended with being of the best players in League of Legends and Team Fight Tactics.

        League of Legends having a free to play game model was the exception not the norm. For the most part, games today are still 
        pay to play. If you really simplify it, the business cycle of a game developer looks something like this:
    </p>

<p>
    Design Game -> Marketing -> Launch Game -> Ocassional Updates -> 
</p>

As a gamer and marketer here are some of my thoughts:
    </p>

<p>PC gaming has been becoming more popular while Console Gaming has been on the decline. I believe this is partly due to 
    PC becoming more widely accessible and game developers developing for PC first.
</p>

  <p class="center-text">In 2022 Console revenue was $52.9B, PC revenue $38.1B</p>

<p>Another side effect of the rising popularity of PC games is that most games are published on STEAM. STEAM also has a 2hour
    refund policy. While gameplay trailers are still very important for creating hype, the gameplay itself and the content creators you partner
    with are far more important.
